The Pub Sub sample feature was designed to illustrate how you might take advantage of the shared mqtt connection that exists in the {\ttfamily Shared\+Crt\+Resource\+Manager}. The Pub Sub sample feature will publish data from a configured {\ttfamily publish-\/file} to a {\ttfamily publish-\/topic}, and will recieve messages on a configured {\ttfamily subscribe-\/topic} and write them to a {\ttfamily subscribe-\/file}.

The feature also allows you to retrigger the publish action by sending a message with the payload {\ttfamily D\+C-\/\+Publish} to the configured {\ttfamily subscribe-\/topic}.\hypertarget{md__home_runner_work_aws-iot-device-client_aws-iot-device-client_source_samples_pubsub__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md39}{}\doxysubsubsection{Configuring the Pub Sub Sample feature via the J\+S\+O\+N configuration file}\label{md__home_runner_work_aws-iot-device-client_aws-iot-device-client_source_samples_pubsub__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md39}
